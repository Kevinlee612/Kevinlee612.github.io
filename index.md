### **About Me**
I'm currently an undergraduate at the University of California San Diego and major in Computer Science (B.S) and Mathematics-Economics (B.S).\
My infatuation with the capabilities of well-designed software is what led me to delve into the field of software. I hope to lead a start-up in the near future.\
I am very interested in the field of finance (hence a business minor) and am currently a CFA Level 1 candidate.\

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Kevinlee612/Kevinlee612.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
